## 🗣️ Discussion Summary

**1. Review Issues / Things Not Achieved in Milestone 3**  
- Javadocs were not compiling properly — need to investigate and consult the TA.  
- Some test cases for functions remain incomplete. Each member will write test cases for their respective code.  
- General reminders:  
  - Always pull from the main branch before starting work.  
  - Retire or rename outdated branches.  
  - Check emails for code review updates and respond promptly to pull/commit requests.  

**2. Geo-location Feature**  
- Conducted a poll on whether to include the optional geolocation feature.  
- Team decided not to include it for now; if the app is completed before the deadline, this feature can be added later.  

**3. Team Distribution (Admin vs Organiser)**  
- **Admin Team:** Vansh Taneja, Aakansh Chatterjee, Sai Vashnavi Jattu  
- **Organiser Team:** Jagjot Brar, Aalpesh Dayal, Digaant Chokkra  
- The Admin team will later assist with UI development and integration once core functionalities are complete.  

**4. Timeline Discussion**  
- **Nov 18 (9 PM):**  
  - Develop and finalize ideas for the “Special Addition” feature.  
  - Discuss database structure and required changes.  
  - Update branches with the latest main branch code; close unused ones.  
- **Nov 22 (9 PM):**  
  - Progress update on assigned tasks.  
  - Review distribution of remaining work.  
- **Final Meeting — Nov 26 (9 PM):**  
  - Ensure the entire app is functional and ready for submission.  
  - Focus on final bug fixes, polish, and testing.  

**5. Other Concerns**  
- Database structure needs adjustments to better store required details.  
- Currently, there are separate event and waiting list structures.  
- Aalpesh proposed modifying the waiting list into a collection for his notification feature.  
- He will test the new structure and inform the team of any resulting issues.  

**6. Special Addition Feature**  
- Team will brainstorm semi-solid, feasible ideas before the next meeting.  
- **Vansh’s Proposal:** Incorporate AI for intelligent search and event filtering in the app.
