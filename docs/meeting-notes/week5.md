## 🗣️ Discussion Summary

**1. Milestone 3 Progress**
- Team discussed the current progress on Milestone 3.  
- Confirmed that chosen issues must be addressed and functional in the main branch.  
- The codebase should be organized under the `code` folder.  
- Regular commits of meaningful, reviewed code are required moving forward.  

**2. Admin Access Clarification**
- Admin account access is checked during login.  
- Need to ensure proper validation for admin credentials.  
- This logic should be clearly reflected in the authentication documentation.  

**3. Task Assignment and Documentation**
- Each member will be responsible for specific implementation areas.  
- Documentation must clearly explain how to run the app, including setup and environment notes.  
- Documentation must remain updated as new changes are merged.  

**4. Quantity of Work Remaining**
- Discussed remaining tasks for the project and what is required to complete Milestone 3.  
- Confirmed expectations for testing, documentation, and UI consistency.

## 🧩 Deliverables and Tools Discussed

### Half-way Checkpoint Features Completion
- Chosen issues must be addressed and functional in the main branch.  
- Ensure the codebase resides under the `code` folder for structure and consistency.  
- Perform regular commits of meaningful, reviewed code.  

### UML Diagrams
- Begin coding first, then design UML diagrams based on actual architecture.  
- Still planning UMLs for larger code implementations.  
- Utilize an online service or tool (e.g., Lucidchart, Draw.io) for collaborative UML creation.  

### UI to XML Conversion
- Best practice: create a shared set of XML UI layouts so all members work from the same files.  
- Adjust or extend UI XML files as needed during development.  
- UI files can be added, deleted, or modified as the project evolves.  

### Test Cases for Backend
- Test cases must be comprehensive and account for edge cases.  
- Each member should write test cases for their own implementations.  
- Tests should include both positive and negative scenarios for reliability.
