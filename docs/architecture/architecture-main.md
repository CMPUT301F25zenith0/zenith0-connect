## 🧩 Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of how different parts of the application interact, the technologies used, and how data moves through the system.

> 💡 *For details on individual components, refer to the linked documents below.*

## ⚙️ Backend Design

The backend is responsible for handling API requests, managing business logic, and interacting with the database.

- **Framework / Language:** _e.g., Java, Android Studio Enviornment, Firebase 
- **Key Modules:**
  - Authentication & Authorization
  - API Endpoints
  - Data Processing / Business Logic

This section outlines the data storage design, including entities, relationships, and schema diagrams.

- **Database Type:** _e.g. Firebase_
- **Main Entities:**
  - Users
  - Events
  - etc.

📄 **Detailed Schema:**
