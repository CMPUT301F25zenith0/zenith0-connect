## 🚀 Overview

<!-- Need to fill details -->

**Zenith-Connect** is a mobile application designed to make community event sign-ups fair, accessible, and stress-free. Instead of a first-come, first-served system, it uses a lottery mechanism to randomly select participants from a waiting list after a registration period. Organizers can create and manage events, upload images, scan QR codes, and track participation through Firebase integration. With distinct roles for entrants, organizers, and admins, Zenith-Connect ensures an inclusive and efficient experience for all users.
